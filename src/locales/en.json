That is precisely why there are Phøs, Phaddrar and a whole guild with a heart of gold that is here to guide you through your first time as a student."

On the first day at LTH, you are divided into a mentor group and will be directly introduced to both newly admitted and old students. The phadders who have experience of life at LTH will help and support you and will be able to answer all kinds of questions. The phadder group will be a safe point throughout the nollning, but over time you will of course socialize with others at the reset as well!"

The nollning is completely voluntary and the large mix of activities means that you can participate in what suits your interests. The most important thing is that EVERYONE who participates should feel that they become part of a guild's community, feel safe at LTH and make friends for life."

In the old days, you joined the nation that represented the country or geographic region you came from, but nowadays all students can join any nation they want. Common to all nations is that all students are often welcome at the events organized, even if they are not members. However, members can receive certain benefits such as cheaper entry or standing in the nation's housing queue. So look around at the different nations below and see which one suits you best! If you are not satisfied with the nation you have joined, you can always change next term!"
