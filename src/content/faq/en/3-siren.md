title: What's the loud noise I hear every few months in Sweden?
---

On the first Monday of March, June, September, and December, at 3 PM, the civil defense sirens are tested all throughout Sweden. These sirens are mounted on most taller buildings. This might be unsettling if you don't know if it's a test. So if you hear a siren, check if it's 3 PM on a Monday, and if so, you're good!
