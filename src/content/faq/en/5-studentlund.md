In order to attend any events at nations or get accomodation at AF Bostäder, you need to be a member of <a href="https://www.studentlund.se/en/">Studentlund</a> where you have to join a nation. 

&nbsp;

Unlike the student corps of other faculties, Teknologkåren is independent of Studentlund. You need to be a member in order to attend events at Teknologkåren. You can find more information at <a href="https://en.tlth.se/">en.tlth.se</a>.
