title: What is the E-Guild policy on alcohol and narcotics?
---
As a Guild under Teknologkåren, we stand behind the officially ratified Alcohol and Drug Policy. The general stance is that no one should feel compelled or swayed to consume alcohol in order to fit in at Teknologkåren or E-Guild events. At any time alcoholic beverages are served, a non-alcoholic option MUST be available.

&nbsp;

Teknologkåren has zero tolerance for the use of any kind of narcotics apart from tobacco and alcohol, with the exception of medicinal use. More infromation can be found <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vVQBDkb0ZfbyTNK-U4Ddsw_T0RI1Kf69/view?usp=sharing">here</a>.
