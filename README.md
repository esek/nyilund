## üåè Localization

Internationalization is done using a custom built solution.

The [`<MainLayout />`](./src/layouts/main-layout.astro) component has a `locale` prop that is used to determine which language to use.
Then, all subcomponents that require translations also have a `locale` prop.
This can then be used in conjuction with the [`getTranslations`](./src/locales/index.ts) function to retrieve a tuple of the translation function as well as the routes for the current locale.

### Translations
The translations are placed in the [`locales`](./src/locales) folder, and exported from the [`index.ts`](./src/locales/index.ts) file.

## ‚ùì FAQ

The FAQ section is built using markdown files in the [`content/faq`](./src/content/faq) folder. These are placed in their relative language folder, and are then imported in the [`<FAQ />`](./src/components/faq.astro) component. This is done in order to be able to use more advanced markdown features, such as links and headings.
